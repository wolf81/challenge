## Project Description

### EWT Challenge - Power your train
Society has waking up to the need to reinvent energy. The way energy is produced but also consumed. Governments, corporations and citizens are in conversation to find solutions to the devastating effects our current energy model has on the environment and therefore the world.

We believe that the three actors should come together. An interplay where being energy conscious should become natural behaviour. The digital infrastructure of EWF gives way to introduce new models of energy transactions.

### Concept
Our idea is to remodel public transportation where users literally power their own journeys. 

In western Europe, more and more buses, metros and trains run on alternative fuel. We now want consumers to pay for rides on these vehicles by transferring  their generated energy to the transportation provider.

Households that have generated an oversupply of energy, can now make good use of this and trade it for an expense (transportation ticket) they most likely would have made any way.

The transportation provider will be paid in energy which could lower their costs, or that they can sell themselves and therefore still earn money.

This concept will help EWFs goal by increasing the value of renewable energy. Energy will now become a means to pay for services. Services that by its nature (sustainable modes of transportation) also contribute to lowering emission costs. 

We expect that this model will have a compounding effect: 

- It will become cheaper for consumers to use public transportation, therefore making more use of it - and lower the usage of “dirty” car traffic. 
- Transportation providers will see an uptick in demand and will invest more in sustainable modes of transport.

### How To Develop This
There are varies way to implement this concept. It all depends on the participants who want and can join.

Ideally it would be an all-encompassing ecosystem that connects all parties and requires little input from the consumer. Example: in the app of his energy provider, a user can set to automatically move a percentage of the self-generated oversupply in energy to a public transportation fund. The money value of this will be then transferred to his public transportation account.

We will utilize the EWT blockchain to execute the energy transaction. The smart contract (powered by pricing oracles provided by ChainLink) will determine the money value of this transaction.

### Lean approach
We are confident that this concept will take off and can be implemented. It is a very complex undertaking however with numerous parties involved. Therefore, we prefer to take the lean approach and start off on a small scale to develop an MVP.

We want to develop a test case in our home country of The Netherlands. We want to involve parties that are already closely aligned with EWF.

In The Netherlands, the biggest transportation provider is the NS. They run the national rail service. In cooperation with their energy partner Eneco, they invest in durable energy. All trains are 100% powered by wind energy, and station halls are powered by green energy.

The NS would be a perfect fit as they play a leading role in providing an eco-friendly service. Their partnership with Eneco is perfect for us, as Eneco is already part of the EWF ecosystem.

If we get these parties interested, an explorative test product can be created. Again, NS is a great fit for this as they heavily invest in “digital experiments” from within their NS Labs department. Whereas Eneco is committed to involving consumer in making energy more efficient.

The Dutch grid provider Stedin is also one the foundation member of EWF, and could therefore be willing to cooperate in this project. 

All payments for public travel are done via a (digital) account managed by TransLink. All transportation providers are part of this system, including NS. A further investigation is needed to understand if involvement of TransLink is required or if we can cover they payment journey directly with NS.

* **Members**: Alexis Vos, Gerhard Schreurs, Wolfgang Schreurs
* **Code Repositories**: https://github.com/wolf81, https://github.com/alexisvos
* **Website**: http://mobowski.com
* **Team's Experience**:

The product development of this proposal, would very much relay on the participating parties. It has to be integrated with their environments after all.

Our team can help in developing the product strategy, user research and integrating with existing mobile apps.

We have a vast experience with mobile development. We ran our own mobile development agency called Mobowski between 2010 and 2015.
